What was the hardest part of the implementation?
- Learning a new language in 3 days and then start building a solution.

○ What would be your next couple of tasks if you had more time?

- I would add bamboo to actually send the emails when someone forgets their password. The current email gets logged out using the Pow dependency.
- I would wire the relationship so instead of the user id it would show the Pharmacy Name
- I'm new to this language so I was focusing on trying to get as many of the features in place that I wasn't able to get up any testing. So if I had more time I would learn and implement testing rules.

○ How could we change the project to be more interesting?
It was a pretty great exercise. It created a usecase that allowed for various degrees of difficulty.
